iJ1 macros for T cell and tumor cell segmentation by manual thresholding of fluorescence intensity.
- Please define the values for thresholding CAR T and Tumor cell channels. Always check before running
- This Macros will create segmented channels for T cell calcium flux and the immune synapse (intersection between T cell and Tumor cell channel)
- The output file will contain the original channels plus the segmented T cell channel for calcium analysis and the synapse channel.
